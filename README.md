# Analyzing-Power-BI

## INTRODUCTION

Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive and interactive insights.

The data might be an excel spreadsheet or a collection of cloud-based and on premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI helps easily connect to data sources, visualize and discover what's important and share that with anyone or everyone.

## Problem Statement
1. Import "Bank term  deposit subscription" dataset into power bi desktop using the csv file option.
2. Load the dataset into a database in SQL server,connect power bi desktop to this database and import only the first 25 rows into the desktop for analysis.
3. Estensively clean the "Employee.csv" ,"Department" and "Salary" dataset provided under the dirty database folder in the drive .

## Skills Demonstrated

1. Cleaning of the bank term deposit subsciption dataset in excel worksheet.
2. Importing of the bank term dataset in power bi using text/csv file format.
3. Importing bank full dataset into SQL server and connecting it to power bi to transform.
4. Cleaning of employee, department and salary datasets and merge them in power bi.

## Data Analysis

I downloaded the bank term depost subsription dataset which is in csv format , i used  excel to clean the dataset after which i saved it .
I used power bi to import the bank full dataset using the 'text/csv file' format

This is the outcome of it

On the second task, i imported the bank full dataset into my  microsoft SQL server under the 'product' database. i created a bank full table .
Then i connected the sql server to power bi and i imported the data

Using query command ,only the first 25 rows were uploaded into the power bi.

After loading the dataset , i viewed it with the table view option in powerbi

On the third task, i cleaned the employee, department and salary dataset in excel, imported them into my power bi , transformed them in power query and merged them using the 'merge' option linking the three datasets with leftjoin query.

The name of the merged datasets is 'merged 1'

## Conclusion
+ Power bi is an interesting tool to work with, makes process of visualization easy to comprehend.
 I will be embarkng on more tasks on power bi to familiarize myself with power bi tools.
